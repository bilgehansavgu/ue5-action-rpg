This repository contains my action RPG for the Unreal Engine course I took from robot_dreams with the instructor Eren Ã‡elik.

### TO DO

1. Refactor AARPGCharacter class with Controllers
2. Set a collision profile for attached equipages
3. Refactor weapon attachment logic
4. NotifyState refactoring (maybe lambda function field variable?)
