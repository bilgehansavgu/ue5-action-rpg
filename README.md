This repository contains my action RPG for the Unreal Engine course I took from robot_dreams with the instructor Eren Ã‡elik.

### TO DO

1. Refactor AARPGCharacter class with Controllers
2. Set a collision profile for attached equipages
3. Refactor weapon attachment logic
4. NotifyState refactoring (maybe an event to notify character)
5. Add projectile initial sfx
6. Put something like a cooldown for the Weapon draw
